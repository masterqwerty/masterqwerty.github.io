**Week of 21 Feb 2022**

* Goals
  * Understand the C++ code for the HLS cores in the traffic generator.
  * Become more familiar with how to create HLS cores. (Modify an HLS core in the traffic generator to verify understanding.)
  * Find other papers to read on network reliability to become more familiar with the research done and to be done in this field.
* Hours This Week: 0.5
* Log
  * *(Mon)* Went through C++ code for Driver HLS core of Traffic Generator.

**Week of 14 Feb 2022**

* Goals
  * Re-read thesis by Hayden on the reliability testing platform for FPGA-based network systems.
  * Come up with three possible research questions to discuss with Dr. Wirthlin
* Hours This Week: 4
* Log
  * *(Thu)* Finished re-reading thesis by Hayden on the reliability testing platform for FPGA-based network systems, and came up with a few possible research questions.
  * *(Fri)* Brainstormed to come up with a few more possible research questions.
  * *(Sun)* Went through C++ code for Generator and Sequencer HLS cores of traffic generator.
  * *(Sun)* Consolidated research notes into a single notebook for better accessibility.
